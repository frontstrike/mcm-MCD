# mcm-MCD
Simple library that allows you to calculate the m.c.m(LCM) or M.C.D(GCD)

# Build
Run the script `compile.sh`
This will create a shared library in /usr/lib/

I also created two programs that returns the result of the LCM and GCD, you will find them in the src_lcm_GCD folder.

To compile the program that uses this library pass this parameter: -llcmGCD
